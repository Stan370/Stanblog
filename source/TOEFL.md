1.阐述背景，转述题目

In the reading material, the author cites three reasons to support his viewpoint that Brendan the Navigator was the first Europeans to reach North America during their voyage. Nevertheless, the lecturer in the listening material argues that the argument raised by the author might not be real and there is no strong evidence to his argument, to oppose the points in the reading material.

First and foremost, the author argues that the written stories of Brendan's voyage make references to places that share characteristics with correct locations of those islands, such as Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Greenland. However, the lecturer offers an opposite stand that in that time people share quotations of the places of those islands. And she knew the dangers from Ireland to North America cause the burst of the volcano results in a hell of fire.

Second, the lecturer casts doubt on the author's another reason that the researcher's boat is not exactly like Brendan's in length, the former is longer. So, he thought it was not sufficient to prove that the boat technology at that time was sufficient for a journey across the Atlantic Ocean; the author also demonstrates that the ancient wooden frame stretched over it and the materials and techniques were available at that time.

Eventually, the author's third point that there are old markings at several locations in NA cut into rocks, which is old Irish alphabet in Brendan's time, prove that Brendan's crew made them is counteracted by the lecturer point that other letters weren't Irish alphabet, which could be made by native American.

Nowadays, there is a common belief that success is not the most important thing; it is more important to remain happy and optimistic when we fail. I totally agree with that point based on my past experiences and considerations. On account of the prevalence of the notion of triumphalism, the **phenomenon** of over-competing and over-pushing from outside, we, young adults are forced to **bury ourselves in** chasing success, instead of following our hearts, following our interests and dreams.

First, there is no such thing as a standard to judge a person's life to be successful or a failure. Success should be different from person to person, it is not an objective existence but a subjective concept. For instance, I am in love with painting and I have been dreamt of creating a worldwide work as Picasso did. Therefore earning much money is not an important thing, to be successful in business is not a success in my mind, devote to creation to achieve my dream is what I need. Maybe I cannot be successful in a long period, but as long as I am striving for my dreams and keep an optimistic attitude towards life that I can find something more inspiring beyond success, which is the meaning of life.

Moreover, failure is the mother of success. If we could not handle the pressure of fail, we cannot bear the crown of victory. For example, Beethoven persisted to practice piano since childhood and produced many marvelous pieces of music, but he lost his hearing gradually since 28. It is hard to imagine a musician without ears, he suffered from this disease and even wanted to suicide, but he didn't give up on fate after the gloomy time and created more world-famous tracks afterward. He said: I want to tightly grip the throat of destiny, it must not let you give in. He was a fresh example of who remain happy and optimistic when failing.

Last but not least, being immersed in the joy of success will blind your eyes. There's an old saying in China, life springs from sorrow and suffering, death comes from ease and pleasure. Many emperors drowning in sex and having fun.

It cannot be denied that a good grade is needed under various circumstances – employment, application to graduate schools, or showing-off between friends. As a result, some might recommend students to take courses that are less challenging for better grades on transcript. However, **as far as the** effectiveness of education, the cost associated with making mistakes, and social relationship **are concerned, I hold the view that** students ought to face the most difficult manageable challenges in school.

First of all, the purpose of education is to prepare young talents for the development society – more specifically, students **bridge themselves between years of training in the fundamentals with practical problems in the world**. Practical problems exist due to their difficulty as most easy ones are usually already resolved in the long process of the development of our civilization. For instance, clean energy, space exploration, and global inequality in the distribution of wealth are all extremely difficulty pending problems. As a result, students, who are responsible for the progress of mankind’s civilization, need to equip themselves with not only the skills but also the necessary attitude – a combination of courage, confidence, and problem-solving skills – at the initial stage of their life, namely education.

Second, while some might claim that students may get a bad grade from challenging courses, this is actually a highly cost-effective way of learning. Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov’s yell on the flaws of the spaceship Soyuz I in the last several minutes of his life, before he was burned to ash, paved the way for the safest and most stable space launch platform in the rest of the 20th century until today. In the meantime, students learn from their mistakes in the least costly way as they will almost never lose their job, life, or even the status of a student from a failure in a course or exam. On the other hand, they can derive issues in their body of knowledge, problem-solving skills, and attitude from the bad results, and work on them. Even though some might claim that bad grades might negatively influence students’ future employment, this is actually easily offset by the experience students can share and utilize from the challenge.

A voice arises that one purpose of education is to help students build a sense of community and communication, and courses that are overly difficult could overwhelm students with academic materials, sacrificing other purposes of education. Ironically, such a claim is biased as a series of team-working elements have already been embedded into various stages of education – volunteering activities, sports, and team-working projects. Multiple courses in both high schools and colleges also require students to form groups to resolve real-life challenges, and students will be able to form a strong friendship that lasts for their life or even be able to identify potential partners for their future endeavor.

In conclusion, students should directly face the challenges they can take in school as this is a highly effective and cost-effective way of learning. While one sees a circle and another sees a zero, I believe my opponents will compromise after being shown to my article.

**It cannot be denied that** the construction of a modern society takes a great number of talents who **excel in** subjects that could directly advance the development of our economy – natural science, social science, and humanity. The fact leads some to place less weight on the education of art and music on young kids, while others insist that art and music ought to be made mandatory. **In my opinion, as far as the effectiveness of education, the building of cultural and national identity, and a universal interest in art and music are concerned, younger kids should be exposed to art and music education to a certain level.**

First of all, art and music, which is a more “nonlinear” aspect of education, is a necessary complementary part to those seemingly more pragmatic subjects. In most branches of mathematics, languages, science, and history, there is almost always a determined “logical” path to follow or “correct” destination / answer that students need to eventually land on. On the other hand, students are encouraged to think in a much more diverse and discrete manner in art and music, which in turn leads them to apply the methodology studied in other subjects in a more effective way in the real world, as there usually is no determined path or correct answer in how to erect the next tallest building on the planet, how to land mankind on Mars, or how to invent a more effective system for language learning.

Second, art and music are effective tools to build a clear cultural, national, and even personal identity. The mysterious smile of Mona Lisa, the seemingly monotonic yet appealing performance of Peking Opera, the signature use of color contrast on Soviet-era paintings…etc., all these unique elements in the world of art and music allow young kids to build an initial sense of national ownership and responsibility, as they deem themselves both owners of the masterpieces and successors to the old masters. This initial sense then further evolves into national pride, cultural identity, and even a determination in making contribution to the society through a pursuit in his or her field of interest, regardless of whether it is directly related to art and music.

Nevertheless, **a voice arises that not every kid is interested in art and music, and we should not force them to study what they do not like. Ironically, this statement does not hold under meticulous scrutinization – while not everyone is interested in performing a form of art or music, they are well enjoyed by almost all people, and even young kids if guided appropriately. As a result, under some guidance, young kids could appreciate the charm of art and music, instead of being forced into painting a huge piece of canvas or composing a symphony.**

In conclusion, a certain exposure to music and art is beneficial to both young kids and at a higher social level. There are one thousand Hamlets in one thousand people’s eyes, yet I am confident that my opponents will compromise after being shown to my argument.

Personally speaking, I prefer XXX, just because XXX saves me a lot of time/is a waste of time. You know, I'm a junior student and I major in Computer science. I have tons of work to do every day like writing my experiment report, tracing and dealing with my data, and preparing the courses for the next day. I spent most of my time in the laboratory and library every day, and also I have to do some internships in my spare time. So I don't have any time to waste.
